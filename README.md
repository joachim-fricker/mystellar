# mystellar

Goal is to write an WebApp for managing the pictures which i haven taken with my unistellar evscope 2.

First phase is the buildCatalog node application which parses a local directory structure and creates the catalog.json file which contains all information about the varaious deep sky objects i have vistited :-)
